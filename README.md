What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this project, I was trying to create a system that helps plan and manage college courses. The main issue was how to organize different courses with their unique numbers, titles, and prerequisites. I wanted something that students could use easily to understand what courses they need to take and what classes they should complete first. It was all about making course planning simpler and less confusing.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To address this issue, I first determined what information I needed to keep track of for each course. I immediately discovered that each course contained details that needed to be put together, such as the course number, name, and what other courses you had to take before signing up for it. Understanding data structures came in useful here. I utilized structures to group these various bits of information together. Then I used a vector to create a list of these structures since I knew it would make adding new courses and browsing through existing ones much easier.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I hit a few bumps along the road, particularly when it comes to determining the best ways to organize and search through the data. One significant issue was ensuring that I could locate certain courses in the list and print information about them. Initially, my searches returned no results or returned strange errors. So I stepped back and performed some debugging, double-checked how I was using the 'find_if' function, and re-read some notes on how these kind of searches worked. I finally got it to work after some trial and error and frustration.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project forced me to reconsider the planning step of software development. I understood that how you put things up at the start has a significant impact on everything that follows. For example, by deciding early on to use structures and vectors, I avoided issues later when I wanted to add more features. I also discovered that sometimes the simplest solution is the best. To get the task done, you don't necessarily need sophisticated approaches or intricate code.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project taught me a lot about developing code that others can understand and that I can simply upgrade in the future. I started paying more attention to how I named things and ordered my code so that anyone else who looked at it wouldn't be confused. I also began to consider what could need to be changed or added in the future. So I designed my code in such a way that making such changes wouldn't need recreating everything from scratch. Basically, I learnt to write with the future in mind, which was something I hadn't given much thought to previously.
